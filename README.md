This is my capstone project, Showindow.

# Showindow
This project is for recommending fashion items based on **the machine learning**.

Showindow use a fashion recommendation algorithm combining collaborative filtering and content information.
Recommender systems attempt to predict new items considering interest for a user.
Most recommender systems use Collaborative Filetering or Content-based methods. 
While both methods have their own advantages, individually they fail to provide good recommendations in many situations.
In this service, Showindow, we develop an effective framework for combining content-based filtering and collaborative filtering.

This service is consist of both of Web Application(PHP Codeigniter) and Backend system(Machine Learning).
